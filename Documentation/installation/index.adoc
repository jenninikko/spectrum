To start working with Spectrum, you need:

* xref:../installation/binary-cache.adoc[Set up the binary cache] to speed up the build process.
* xref:../installation/getting-spectrum.adoc[Build Spectrum] from the source.

TIP: At this stage, Spectrum works only on x86-64.  AArch64 support is in
development.

== Uninstalling and Updating

Currently, there is no implementation for a software update.

You can replace Spectrum by installing another OS.
