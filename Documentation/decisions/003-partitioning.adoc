== Status

Proposed

== Context

Partitions are required to install the Spectrum operating system, VMs
and store user data.

== Decision

----
<blockdevice>                        # EFI system partition
<blockdevice>                        # XBOOTLDR
<blockdevice>                        # A
<blockdevice>                        # B
# first 32 GB are reserved for Spectrum system
# rest of the disk is reserved for user data
<blockdevice>n-1                     # bootstrap user data
<blockdevice>n to the end of disk    # user data
----

== Consequences

- LVM may support resizing - both increasing and decreasing with some limitation
when there's alreay data on volume(s).
- Does LVM work with all disk types?
- We have to implement XBOOTLDR to support EFI system partition
  created by Windows -- to support dual boot.
