== Status

Proposed

== Context

For privacy protection, encryption of user data at rest is required.

== Decision

User data is encrypted.

== Consequences

Spectrum needs to come with enough software to get the encryption key
via different methods (password, usb, fido, etc.).  Can we use dm-crypt
for everything instead of LUKS?
