== Status

Proposed

== Context

Based on identified different audiences for the Spectrum release it is
proposed we support three base configurations to use with Spectrum, to
be chosen from at the first boot.

== Decision

Minimal :: Spectrum host + system VMs: network VM, GUI VM, USB VM.
xref:004-data-at-rest-encryption.adoc[Encrypted] user data partition.
Common :: Minimal + browser app VM + 2-3 selected application VMs.
Power :: Common + NixOS VM.

== Consequences

Requires a first boot VM (like a wizard) to allow the user to choose
their configuration and get started.
