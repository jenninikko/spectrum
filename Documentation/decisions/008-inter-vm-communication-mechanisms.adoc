== Status

Proposed

== Context

Guest VM software needs to communicate with software in other guest VMs.

== Decision

Spectrum provides two mechanisms for inter-guest communication:

- TCP/IP with virtio-net
- Cross-domain virtio-gpu which can send references to shared memory
  and be used as a transport for a stream protocol, e.g. Wayland.

== Consequences

- Examples will be required on how to write applications which
  communicate over virtio-gpu.
