== Status

Proposed

== Context

Certain VMs will need access to specific USB devices, but with passthrough from
the host we can only pass through whole USB controllers, not individual devices.

== Decision

USB controllers will be passed through to a VM with authorization controls
inside the VMs to forward a specific USB device using USBIP.

== Consequences

We need to modify the upstream USBIP daemon to support authorization.
